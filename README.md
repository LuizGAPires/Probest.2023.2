# 🎲 Final Project – Probest 2023.2

This repository contains the final project notebook for the **Probabilistic Models and Statistics** course of the second semester of 2023.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This notebook explores probabilistic modeling through the lens of real data using tools from statistics and probability theory. It employs modern Python-based statistical tools to:

- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Construct and simulate probabilistic models
- Visualize and interpret results
- Evaluate statistical assumptions and model performance

The approach emphasizes conceptual clarity, reproducibility, and practical implementation of theoretical constructs taught in the course.
